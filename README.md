# WLMerge
A tool to merge Bricklink Wanted Lists

# Usage
- Drop any valid Bricklink Wanted list (.xml) into the app, or browse for them.
- One or more files can be added at the same time
- Change multiplier as desired, each piece count in the files selected will be multiplied with this (1 is default)
- Columns can be sorted by clicking on headers
- Click on piece id to launch the details page on Bricklink for that piece
- At any time more files can be added, they will be merged as well
- Clear to start over
- Export will copy the merged list to clipboard, ready to be pasted into Bricklink import page

# Notes
- Remarks in list will be merged; first file leftmost and succeeding files on right, separated by double vertical bars ||
- Other fields will be overwritten (part from remarks, piece id and color), last file added for each lot will determine value
